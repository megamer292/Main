    <h1>TUTORIAL</h1>
  <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
  <p>The main purpose of this file/site is to hide games sites from blocksi, as due to the file being under a <strong>file//</strong> url, most in-window content cannot be accessed by the extension. Any updates to the file will roll out slowly, but the process can be sped up by clearing browser cache.</p>
  <h2>DISPLAYING SITES</h2>
  <p>The first input box is for providing URLs to the site you want displayed. This does not work for any site, only those which allow Iframe embedding. The file uses an Iframe as its main method of displaying sites.<strong>BUTTONS:</strong></p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>"Change Normal Frame Link":</strong> This button sets the site that the file displays through the URL inputted into the first input box.</li>
          <li><strong>"Change Basic Unblocked Frame Link":</strong> This button is fairly similar to the previous button, but passes the URL through a simple unblocker. (Note: Primarily unblocks top level blocksi sites, but if the unblocked site has another blocked Iframe within it, such Iframe may remain blocked)</li>
          <li>Every other button in this row simply sets the Iframe's URL to a predetermined site, ignoring anything inside the input box.</li>
      </ul>
  <p>Warning: make sure that any url inputted includes its starting http/https segment. If it is left missing the site will not be displayed.</p>
