  <h1>TUTORIAL</h1>
  <h2>BASICS</h2>
  <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
  <p>The main purpose of this file/site is to hide games sites from blocksi, as due to the file being under a <strong>file//</strong> url, most in-window content cannot be accessed by the extension. Any updates will roll out slowly, but the process can be sped up by clearing browser cache.</p>
  <h3>DISPLAYING SITES</h3>
  <p>The first input box is for providing URLs to the site you want displayed. This does not work for any site, only those which allow Iframe embedding.</p>
